# Use Cases
* UC1: Log exersise
  * This is a user case because the parents will be logging the activity of their child. The goal would be to reach 60 minutes a day, so the parent would be logging the exersise duration either all at once or multiple times a day. Logging the exersise also brings the user to a new part of the application, which gives them more pages to interact with. (BR2)
* UC2: Play games
  * There is a page that has many interactive games for a user to play with, specifically the children. There is a carousel for the user to also interact with to choose the game. The games will help with the mission of making kids learn more about being healthier by playing games teaching about good habits. (BR1)
* UC3: Login to the application
  * There is a login feature for the parents to be able access their account. This account will be used to be able to log the exersise of their child. They will be able to register for an account with an email on the register page. (BR2)
* UC4: Read recipies
  * There is a specific page that displays all the recipes that the parent could make for their child to eat healthier. There is a featured recipe every day and each recipe has its own page. The parent of the child will be able to learn about the ingredients needed, the steps, and the cook time of the recipe. (BR2)
