# Business Requirements
- **BR1**: Increase usage both during and after immersive learning project
 - The client stated that this was basically the main goal of having it be a website--so that students are able to come back to it, and to make them _want_ to keep using it after the program. Since we are not increasing profits, and the whole goal of the immersive learning project is to encourage usage of the web app to make healthier choices by the kids and for the kids by the guardians, this counts as a business requirement.
- **BR2**: Increase parental engagement in the immersive learning program
- If parents are more involved with the program, they can help better encourage their kids to be involved and continue to use the app after the program is done. This further serves **BR1**, allowing for kids to ultimately continue exercising. Similarly, this allows parents to make healthier choices _for_ their kids.
- **BR3**: Encourage kids using the app to make healthier choices
- The whole goal of the immersive learning project is to show kids the benefits of eating healthy and exercising, making this perhaps the most important business requirement of the whole project. Even **BR1** is about encouraging kids to continue using the app after the program, but this extends that requirement to include just _doing_ the activities in general--as long as kids are making more healthy choices for themselves and in their lives, the project was a success--even if kids aren't using the app.
