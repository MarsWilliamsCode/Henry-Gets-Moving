### Ask for information about the client 
 - Adult physical fitness program serves about 150 people
 - Currently has students working on it
 - Specializes in exercise, but has students working on MyPlate®
 - Expanding project ↓
 - Knows author of the book, is in contact with him, gets more books whenever needs more
 - Has a Facebook page
### Type of business 
 - Not really a business
 - Immersive learning project
 	- Been doing for about 4 years
 	- Started with muncie community schools
 	- Been at yorktown, burris, etc
 - Go to schools to work with kids and teachers and stuff
 - Exercise science students
 
### Goals of business
 - Website?
 - Hope that all the schools will begin using it
 
### Explain the project process
 - Did that!!!!!!
 
### Constraints
 - Probably not
 	- Client will ask

### Operating environment 
 - Web app
   - Perhaps React
     - Usable on most platforms
   - Because of the previous capstone team which made the mobile app for the adult physical fitness center which never came to fruition because of the app stores, adult physical fitness serves too few people for the app stores
 - Used primarily on iPads if teachers at schools like it enough
 	- At client's house, doesn't own a desktop, so primarily iPads, and parents on phones for children
 
### Basic Components
 - Game
 	- Interactive
 	- Client's students have project to come up with ideas to help with the app
 		- Coming up with different games, due on October 7th
	- A maze
		- Based off the Squirm maze, which is on a worksheet,
			- Going through a maze eating healthy foods, somewhat like Pac-Man, more interactive version of the worksheets they have
	- Put Jasmine in there somehow, since she helps Henry out throughout the story
	- "Anything kids like that is… y'know… appropriate for that age level"
	- Worksheets had in the past be made into a game, interactive of sorts
 - Healthy recipes
 	- Normal, everyday recipes
 	- Simple / quick recipes for busy families or low-cost recipes
 	- Fruits / vegetables in season for current recipes
 		- Kids are picky - what if kids are more apt to have tomatoes from farmers that taste better? 
 	- Meals, snacks, healthy!
 	- Based on MyPlate® (replacement of pyramid)
 	- Water vs Soda
 	- Provided by client
 	- Recipe of the day
 	- Page with all recipes which can be filtered through, filtered by specific ingredients
 - Exercise
 	- Kids able to log activities
 		- Physical activity, walking around
 		- Sports
 		- Perhaps when reaching 60 minutes, gives a "party" with "confetti", or a "trophy" which can be gradually filled up until they get to 60 minutes a day
	- Exercise of the day, also
	- Sections based on exercises
		- E.g. aerobic, yoga, cardio, balance / flexibility
		- Previous worksheet with "bingo but with yoga"
 - About page talking about the whole immersive learning project, perhaps with the history and stuff
 	- Information possibly taken from Facebook page (Henry Gets Moving Delaware County)
 	- Also include picture of immersive learning team perhaps
 - Recipes perhaps for the adults
 - MAYBE actually just one side of the app, just with maybe sections for parents vs kids
 - Perhaps family exercises
 - Multiple people per account, multiple people with their own exercise logs in the same account
 - Admin panel
 	- To add more recipes in the future, edit the catalog
 	- Also filter out exercises
 - Example: demonstration of teaspoons of sugar in things, on parent side as well as kids' side
 
### Design requirements 
 - Include logo always used for HGM
 - Colorful
 	- Maybe matching the color scheme of the book
 - Simple
 - Easy to read - first grade level
 	- From pre-school to second grade
 - Kid Friendly
   - Perhaps designed like the previous capstone group's mobile apps?
 - Not a lot of security necessary for kids
 - Start page with way to select student / guardian side
 	- Perhaps both are handled with one username, guardian logs in with child's username to see child's user data but in a different way
 
### Communication with external services or hardware
 - Database to store user accounts, perhaps only with a username
 
### How was this problem solved before?
 - Previous capstone students created a mobile app, but it was rejected by the App Store and Google Play Store
 
### Misc
 - Perhaps if time allows, improve the previous mobile app
 - Allow kids to use it after client is done coming to the schools, make children want to continue eating and being healthy afterward
 - Get kids to want to remember things taught by immersive learning project
 - Asked if client could send assets used in the book to be placed on the website
 - Perhaps a second-language version of the site in the future
 - Primary means of communication is email
 - Perhaps a place to read the book on the page
 - Perhaps recordings of Spanish reading of the book
