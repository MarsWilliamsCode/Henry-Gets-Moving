## Topics Discussed
- Progress as opposed to what mentor has last seen
  - Rather minimal
  - Not much is different
  - Forms are disabled unless you fill out the whole form
  - Selecting intensity type changes the background
  - Back-end is finished, in terms of controllers and migrations
  - Connection is in attempt
- "Even if you can't connect everything to the backend, just have a few things - it's easier to show a feature if you can do the thing"
- Still to do: display existing exercises and recipes, log in, make new user, put in new exercises and recipes
## Things Clarified
- Planning out features for next iterations
  - Search functionality, `Game.tsx`
- Possibility of switching back-end from Adonis to Laravel
- Testing for front-end is perhaps not the most important thing
- Don't show off things that aren't entirely finished in the presentation - show off big show-stopper working features
- Reasonable to put in buttons that maybe don't work just to lay out the ground-work for what eventually _will_ work - working in advance is good
