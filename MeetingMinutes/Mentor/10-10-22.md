## Topics Discussed

### Business Requirements
- Showed off business requirements
- "They should ... be the biggest, kinda vague over-arching thing"
- Try not to be too specific
- They could be condensed down into 1 or 2
- Essentially the Point or Reason for making the software
- NOT general use cases
- BR1 is *kind of* a use case
- BR2 is more of a business requirement
- Make very general statements about the point of the whole project, condense the four down into two
- Example, "Create an immersive learning experience for children to use"
- Really really broad
- Perhaps not all business requirements

### Use Cases
- Use cases can be much more specific than Business Requirements
- Can make a ton of them
- Ideally should have multiple use cases per one business requirements
- Could be broken up into infinitely smaller and more specific pieces if it came down to it

### Requirements
- Pretty good!!!!

### Architecture
- Also looks good!!!
- Good and cohesive

### Domain Model
- Also cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Can be difficult to do early on in the project
- The way we have it is good

### TechStack
- AdonisJS and ReactTS
- Epic

### Prototype
- Showed off design of the website: links between pages, home screen, security requirements
- From a UX perspective, looks very good, cool that it's functional
- Pretty extensive prototype for having probably little information

## Other
- How are the views separated? Parents, kids, admin
  - Were planning on Parent / Kid separation, but realized there wasn't enough that they would do differently to warrant it
- Want to focus on doing the exercise rather than logging said exercise
- Only real critique is to condense the business requirements
