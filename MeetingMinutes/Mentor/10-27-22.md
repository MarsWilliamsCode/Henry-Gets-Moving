## Topics Discussed
### Software
- Showed off the front-end
  - Lots of pages not functional because they don't connect to the backend
  - "Eat healthy" on the header should be a drop-down to link to the `/learn-more` page
  - Admin page, only to be accessed via desktop, so mobile styling not necessary
- Showed off the back-end
  - Main priority is getting tests set up and working
  - Our framework has rather little documentation on testing
  - Will likely need an `api-spec.yml`
- Have yet to connect front-end to back-end, so they currently don't communicate
- Mentor thinks we've made very good progress for it being the first iteration
  - Is impressed
  - "You're setting yourselves up pretty well, I think"
  - Recommends making sure of presenting features during our presentations
  - Emphasized importance of connecting front-end and back-end
  - Recommends continuing to maintain tests throughout the whole project
  - Should do the documentation earlier rather than later
  - Advice: get renter's insurance

### Documentation
- Development.md looks good
- That's really all that was said
  - Cats: good

### Other
- Good that we've gotten started so soon
- Should avoid doing things last-minute
- We got this!!!
