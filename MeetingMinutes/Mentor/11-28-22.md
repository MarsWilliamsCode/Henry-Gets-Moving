## Topics Discussed
- How the first iteration went
  - Pretty okay
- Things done on the front-end side:
  - Animated hamburger menu
  - Hamburger menu currently brings up a somewhat ugly white space on the side of the window
  - On-hover drop-down
  - Admin panel now has demonstrations / LearnMore on it
- Mentioned switching back-end frameworks for this iteration, but Laravel ended up not really working
  - Maybe be fine?
- Setting up a mock backend for testing
  - Annoying to set up
  - Not a lot of "Logic" for our project that can be tested
  - Even though testing is uncommon in actual jobs
  - If testing were easier to do, more people would probably do it -- it's just not easy for no good reason
  - Could maybe put something in .env with like a db-test or something?
- Lots of things going on all at the same time
- This iteration is one of the worst, since it's due all at the same time as all the other classes' final projects and such
## Things Clarified
- Should probably contact prof about the prize money for the iteration since we haven't heard about it
- Docker was bonus points and, despite running our project exclusively via `docker compose up` and putting it in our `Development.md` we got 0 points for it
  - Should probably also contact prof about this
- The main goal for this iteration
  - Pretty much everything except the `Game.tsx` page
- Iteration 1 was good functionally, got a lot done that iteration so this one can be more cleanup-ish and finishing up "smaller" things
- Cramming everything in the last week before it's due won't work out, so that we're being consistent is pretty good
- Even if we run out of things to do, there are still things we could probably find to do, despite getting most of the big parts of the project done in the first two iterations
- One main advice:
  - If we tell the professor about a problem we have during the iteration, we likely won't be counted off for it
- mentor recommended using GitHub issue tracking
  - Can create a bunch of different columns, e.g. things we need to do, in progress, waiting for review, done, allows easy communication across times for teammates who tend to work at different times, helping to avoid things getting lost in Slack
  - Would be good experience for pretty much any software engineering jobs after college
  - Allows to make sure two people aren't working on the same thing at the same time
  - Also helps keep track of the workflow
  - Also gives a cool sense of accomplishment when you mark one as done
  - Just a nice thing to practice for future work since most software companies use it, even if not github issues, some other issue tracker
  - Also helps keep track of what got done this iteration
- When is the project expected to be deployed?
  - No real expectation - mentor's group never deployed it and just passed them off to the client
