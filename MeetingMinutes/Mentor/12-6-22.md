  - **Learn more page**
  - Diagrams and demonstrations added to admin panel
  - **Filtering for categories and with search**
  - Mentor says "that's sick"
  - **Pagination so that if there are more exercises or recipes they get split up and can be shown by clicking "see more"**
  - Mentor says "this is solid—it could be polished a little bit but you've really done a lot for the first semester"
  - ExerciseLog form automatically creates family members if they don't exist, and if they do, associates a new log object with them
  - Will be displayed on the Calendar page
  - Hamburger menu no longer overflows, and closes upon clicking out of it and navigating to another page 
- Documentation is mostly the same
  - Cool
## Things Clarified
- Trophy page on the main exercise page has all the assets, but we're saving the functionality for next iteration
- Mentor is very impressed and thinks we will be A-OK
  - We've gotten a lot done in a short amount of time
  - Hopefully we win the money this iteration
  - Coming up on finals makes this iteration a bit hard, but we're in a good spot
  - If we still don't get points for docker this iteration, we should ask conisdering we've been using it the whole project
  - Taking a break over winter break is totally fine - working on it over break is rare
- We're working on things relatively consistently, which is why we're okay — it's not a last minute project, even though we're probably still gonna get things done last minute
- mentor hopes we win this iteration
- hopefully finals aren't too stressful
