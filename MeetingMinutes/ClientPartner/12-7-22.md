## Topics Discussed
- Working on getting assets sent by client recently put into the database for showing-off purposes
- What we got done:
  - LearnMore: can see demonstrations and diagrams, put them in the admin panel
    - attributes we need about these things
  - Filtering / search
    - Can search by names + filter by categories in exercises and recipes
  - Logging exercise
    - Shows up on the calendar page
  - Hamburger menu in the header
    - See more button shows up when there are eight or more items in the database that show up on the page
  - Pagination â†‘
  - Added prep time to recipes
## Things Clarified
- Considering in a future iteration using the YouTube API to not have to add thumbnail images
  - could pull the stuff we need from the YouTube link
  - Limit of 10000ish per day, but should be fine since it would only be used on the admin panel
- Videos in the future will hopefully be more kid-specific, but it's harder to find on the internet sometimes
  - This _could_ show the parents, but the goal is kid-focused
  - Some recipes are simple and appropriate for kids to do, but kids shouldn't be in the kitchen by themselves anyway
- From client: need demonstrations, diagrams, categories for exercises and recipes
  - Hopefully images will be more kid-friendly, hopefully would be of a good size
  - Good thing about the YouTube API is that thumbnail sizes will be standardized
  - Could possibly get exercises and recipes set up to use multiple categories
- Will hopefully be getting it deployed in the next two iterations
