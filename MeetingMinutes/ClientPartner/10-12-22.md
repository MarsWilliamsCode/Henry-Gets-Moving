## Topics Discussed

- Difference between a website and an app
  - This is a website, which could be linked to with a QR code
- Deployment of the website
  - Funds for purchase of domain to deploy
  - Preëmptive deployment
- Deployment schedules — every iteration
- Assignment that was due on the 7th for client's students—small games ideas assignments

  - Can we get a PDF of the book?

  - Client requested link to Figma
  - Information on diagrams requested by client
  - Display different drinks / foods (bad) and how many grams of sugar, e.g., and good ones
  - Information on exercise and recipe categories requested
  - Could include more characters from the book (Squirm, e.g.)
  - Diagrams to fill a page—should they have their own page?
  - Main sections in the book are "get moving" and "eat healthy," so perhaps the website could be split up by "get moving" and "eat healthy" perhaps, as an idea from the client
