## Minute Recorder

## Topics Discussed
- `Development.md` needs to be fixed
- Mars can fix tonight, has whole day off
- Clean code standards and the possibility of the code being not great--web development is kind of inherently un-clean
- The backend tests are still timing out, and we have no idea what's going wrong
- Unit tests of the front-end should technically be good, since they're testing the functionality of the backend _through_ the frontend
- Iterations and things to include in them - perhaps re-working the backend for next iteration, game probably saved for CS 498
- We have a very limited amount of time left, so the way it is is likely going to stay that way
- `User.md` can maybe be done by Melody today
- Discussed times for the presentation for iteration 1, 11 AM Thursday and 10:20 work for all team members
- Possible for iteration 2: CSS `@keyframe` for animation, possibly moving the clouds across the screen
- Discussed possible necessity of `docker-compose.yml` on front-end
- Laravel as a possible new backend
- Possible second iteration features: re-made backend, calendar page, etc
- Will specify later

## Things Clarified
- Unit tests and the connection of the front- and back-ends--will be connected tonight
- Front-end tests are currently clunky, since they add test things and remove things
### Next Steps
- Connect front and back end
- Create `User.md`
