## Topics Discussed
- Admin panel set up, not styled
- Need to email client about deployment and AWS
  - Perhaps more reasonable to deploy on OneDrive instead of AWS to not have to deal with it
- Need to get information about recipes and exercises to add to backend
  - Will store in database
- Storing exercise videos as links
- Deployment
  - What URL does the client want? How should we go about deployment?
  - Suggestion of hosting on `neocities.org`, free tier has a Neocities domain but is free up to 10 GB
  - Current time-out error on backend
- Wrote and constructed an email to client
 ## Things Clarified
 - Backend testing
  - Structure of queries returned from database
  - How to even run them
  - Need to create `api-spec.yml`
  - What to test: authenticated users can access their own data, stuff holds the right data
  - How to do so without going through the frontend?
  - Seeding the database with Factories in Adonis
- Testing would be much easier if done through the frontend, but requires connecting back- and front-end
- Current errors happening with the backend: `User` expects `familyMembers` to have userId, even though they already do
## Next steps
- Create api-spec.yml
- See if that allows tests and stuff to work
  - If it does, yay, if not, uh oh
