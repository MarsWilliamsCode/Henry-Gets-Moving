## Things worked on
- Mocking databases in jest
	- Stupidly hard, dunno why it's so difficult, no tutorials on the internet talking about this
	- tearing my hair out over this
- no one likes unit testing
- More people would do it if it wasn't so difficult
- the whole point is to make sure your code works but you have to spend time even just getting the tests themselves to work
