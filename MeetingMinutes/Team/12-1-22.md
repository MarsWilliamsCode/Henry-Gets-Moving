## Topics Discussed
- LearnMore functionality has been started
- Mock data unit testing: setState isn't working
  - Displays in console.log, but refuses to set the stateful variable
  - just sets to empty array
  - States are weird and can't be passed between methods or pages
  - googled around about it - react states are volatile and difficult to test 
- ExerciseLog form currently doesn't work because of no default value for user_Id
  - Mars will add something to the header to send the bearer of the session key
  - doesn't require editing the backend
- Got an email from the client during the meeting
  - didn't send embed links, so if she didn't get it this time, we should probably add some logic to convert watch links to embed links in a future iteration
  - Could also perhaps integrate with the YouTube API at some point in the future, just to make it easier on Nicole
## Things Clarified
- Unit testing hasn't been amazing. not very easy
  - testing state hooks is kind of a wreck, and calling states from separate files doesn't work
- Due date of the project: December 7th
- Calendar.tsx doesn't work right now, needs exerciselogpage to work
  - inserting data in postman doesn't work for giving a custom createdAt value
- As long as we get the stuff on the checklist done, we should be fine
- Moving team meeting up before the due date
- Iteration 3: focus on the Game page
- Iteration 4: maybe think about deployment
- Iteration 5: touch-ups, espa√±ol
## Next steps
- On MOnday or Tuesday, depending on if the due date is changed, we can go over everything to make sure it all works and do debugging and stuff
- Ask about money
