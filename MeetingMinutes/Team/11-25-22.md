  - User's show method pre-loads entire list of family members
  - Get specific family member pre-loads exercise logs
- Setting up mock backend for testing
  - Laravel may not work
  - Setting up mock database accesses with RESTful API is difficult
- Hamburger menu currently pushes page over and doesn't close when navigating to a new page
## Things Clarified
