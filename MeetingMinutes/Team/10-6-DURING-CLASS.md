## Topics Discussed

 - Future maintenance of the project will be done by undergrads
   - Possibly use PHP not Adonis?
   - Will ask professor about what to do about future maintenance

 - Prototype
   - Still need to connect all the pages for the prototype

 - What to do
   - Easiest document would be the requirements one since that's what we discussed during the discovery meeting
   - Business requirements might be harder since this isn't really a Business, it's just them trying to get kids to exercise

 - What is a business requirement?
   - This isn't a business
   - How do the kids use it?
 - Locations of things to place on GitHub
 - Where should things listed in requirements go on the website?
 - How should the website work?
   - Popups? Different pages?
 - Who are all these requirements for? The diagrams, the MyPlate, etc: for the kids or for the guardians?
 - Worked on BusinessRequirements.md
 - Discussed requirements
 - Noticed requirements have to be connected to business requirements
   - Not good for our project, considering the lack of business requirements
 - How many business requirements do we need?
 - The purpose behind the immersive learning project
 - Asked questions to the professor and awaited responses
 - Discussed desires of the client, purposes of the immersive learning project, how they relate to the requirements and business requirements of the project
 - What happens if it's given to the Corps?

 - We refuse to do Angular
 - It's no longer popular, and React is industry-aware
 - TypeScript is also more up-to-date than PHP
 - Plus, the client doesn't really care
 - React is more used nowadays, and would be more likely to be maintainable
 - Desires of the client with regard to the tech stack
 - Created tech stack document on GitHub
 - Added minutes for this meeting to GitHub
 - Discussed what we're doing at the other meeting we're having later today
 - Assigned out the rest of the design items to the team that were not finished at this meeting

## Things Clarified
 - Every person has two design items to work on before the 12th, and we'll have another meeting which was already scheduled as the meeting for this week at 3 PM today
