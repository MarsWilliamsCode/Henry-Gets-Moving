## Topics Discussed
- Client responded to our email as soon as the meeting started
- Wants to use either teamhenry.org or henrygetsmoving.com
  - Likely will use teamhenry.org, since it appears on the book and is much cheaper than henrygetsmoving.com
- Saving the LearnMore page for the next iteration
  - Difficulties with making it, have to push it back
- Login, register, exercise forms are "functional" while not being hooked up to the database
- Need to get OTD things set up so they're affected by the admin panel
- Does the admin panel need to be functional by this iteration?
- Controllers and migrations (excluding demonstrations / diagrams) in the backend seem to be done
- The tables are mostly done--a small amendment must be made for the recipes
- Made a separate branch for testing so we can mess around with it without breaking anything
- `api-spec.yml` to be done for tonight, see if it helps testing
- If not, we just don't merge the branch
- Hook up front and back-end over weekend
- Need to email client to ask about meeting time for presenting first iteration
- Need to work on documentation, `User.md Deployment.md`
- Checked for reservation availability for BL study rooms, discussed time for client meeting with Nicole - reserved BL201 on the 9th at 3:30 pm
- Need to create new branch for writing tests for functional forms
- Attempted to fix Adonis tests
  - open API spec? added back - will be set up by tomorrow night
  - made new branch for testing
  - Threw stuff at the wall
  - Something eventually stuck - removed the UserFactory and suddenly it works
## Things Clarified
- `docker compose up` vs `node ace serve` - node doesn't create the `.db` directory
- Running tests with connected back-end on GitHub Actions will likely require adding lots of code to clone the backend repository
## Next Steps
- Hook up back end to front end, make it functional
- Finally get some backend tests happening
- Add front-end tests for functional forms
- Make documentation for `User.md` and `Deployment.md`
